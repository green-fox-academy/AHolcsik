        if number_of_people is square root of two 
            the result is one!
        if number_of_people is not suare root of two
            find highest number of power to 2 and decrease it
            repeat for the rest until a remaining number is left 
            #does this make sense?
        the first power of two needs to be excluded
        the number which "starts" then is the winner!

if n = 2 ** number + l and l < 2*number
winner is 2*l + 1

in binary it's even easier but that's cheating
