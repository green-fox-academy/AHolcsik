# Create a class, with one method (eg. get_apple()) that returns a string (eg. "apple")
# Create a test for that:
# Create a test class
# Create a test method
# Instantiate an Object from your class in the method
# Use the assertEquals()
# The expected parameter should be the same string (eg. "apple")
# The actual parameter should be the return value of the method (eg. myobject.get_apple())
# Run the test
# Change the expected value to make the test failing
# Run the test
# Fix the returned value to make the test succeeding again

class GetsApple:

    def get_apple(self):
        return "apple"


# Create a sum method in your class which has a list of integers as parameter
# It should return the sum of the elements in the list
# Follow these steps:
# Add a new test case
# Instantiate your class
# create a list of integers
# use the assertEquals to test the result of the created sum method
# Run it
# Create different tests where you
# test your method with an empyt list
# with a list with one element in it
# with multiple elements in it
# with a null
# Run them
# Fix your code if needed
